The official [Claude in Chrome](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome) extension gives Claude Code full browser automation — as long as you stay within Anthropic's allowlist of "safe" sites. Open Claude in Chrome is a clean-room reimplementation that strips the restrictions while keeping all 18 MCP tools and matching the official extension's performance.

## What's Different

| | Claude in Chrome | Open Claude in Chrome |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain blocklist** | 58 blocked domains across 11 categories | No blocklist. Navigate anywhere. |
| **Browser support** | Chrome and Edge only | Any Chromium browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.) |
| **Source code** | Closed source | Open source (MIT) |
| **Tools** | 18 MCP tools | Same 18 MCP tools |
| **Performance** | Baseline | Statistically indistinguishable cold, and [measurably better](#does-it-actually-match-the-official-extension) with the techniques the open harness allows |

### Blocked Domains in the Official Extension

Open Claude in Chrome has **none of these restrictions**.

## Does it actually match the official extension?

Yes — and rather than assert it, here is a benchmark. **[Read the full study →](benchmark/writeup/writeup.md)**

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/img/parity.png" alt="Turns per task against suite latency: the official extension and this harness cold are ringed together as statistically indistinguishable, with an arrow to this harness's best method showing 23% fewer turns and 15% less time" width="820">
</p>

17 arms, each run over the same 12 held-out tasks from the
[REAL](https://github.com/agi-inc/REAL) web-agent benchmark, same model and
effort throughout (Sonnet, medium). What it found:

- **Parity, out of the box.** The official extension and this harness, both cold,
  are statistically indistinguishable: 2.04 vs 1.95 min/task and 31.4 vs 32.6
  turns, at p=0.44 and p=0.67 on a paired permutation test, with identical
  accuracy. They differ only in per-action overhead — **0.31s vs 0.12s** per
  browser action, 2.7× less.
- **A higher ceiling.** The best method in the study lands **23% fewer turns and
  15% less time** than the official extension, at 11/12 tasks passed against
  8/12. Distil prior runs into a short per-site recipe, put it in the task
  prompt, and start from a warmed-up session.
- **What actually helps.** Mounting raw prior experience on disk costs more than
  it returns (the agent spends 3.5× longer before its first browser action);
  compressing it into the prompt is what pays. Context is the dominant latency
  term at **+1.9s per turn per 100k tokens**, so more context is not free.
- **Recordings.** This harness records raw, four-track browser traces and defers
  the analysis; Claude Cowork analyses each recording at capture time and keeps
  only the result. Distilled the same way by the same model, the raw recordings
  win both regimes — **6.6 fewer turns and 6.4 fewer minutes** when the material
  has to fit in a prompt (p=0.012, p=0.008).

Caveats are in the writeup, not hidden: the task set saturates, one task's
grading is ambiguous, and repeat runs of an identical configuration vary by
10–20%, so treat single-digit differences as noise.

## Architecture

Default:

```
Claude Code <--stdio MCP--> mcp-server.js <--TCP--> native-host.js <--native messaging--> Extension <--> Browser
```

Code mode / hybrid (additive — `mcp-server.js` is reused unchanged as the upstream):

```
Claude Code <--stdio MCP--> server-{codemode,hybrid}.js
                              |  spawns + proxies via MCP
                              v
                            mcp-server.js (child) <--TCP--> native-host.js <--native messaging--> Extension <--> Browser
                              ^
                              |  HTTP tool-callback
                              |
                            workerd (wrangler dev sidecar)
                              |  Worker Loader → V8 isolate
                              v
                            sandboxed Worker runs LLM-written code
```

Three components:
1. **Extension** — Manifest V3 with CDP-based browser automation (all 19 tools)
2. **MCP Server** — Node.js process started by Claude Code, exposes tools via MCP
3. **Native Messaging Host** — Bridge between the MCP server and the extension

The codemode and hybrid servers add a fourth piece — a `wrangler dev` subprocess hosting a Cloudflare Worker that runs the LLM-generated code in a V8 isolate. The Worker calls back to the proxy over HTTP for actual tool execution, which is forwarded to the unchanged upstream `mcp-server.js`.

## Installation

One flow, top to bottom, turns everything on — all 18 browser tools,
`execute_code`, and the imitation-learning recorder.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **Any Chromium browser** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.)
- **Claude Code** v2.1.80+ (the recorder needs channels; browser automation alone works on v2.0.73+)
- **An OpenAI API key** (used to transcribe recording narration)

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --prefix host
npm install --prefix host/codemode/worker
```

The second one is not optional: it provisions the sandbox that `execute_code`
runs in. Skip it and the server falls back to fetching wrangler over the network
on every cold start, which is the most common reason `execute_code` fails to
come up.

### Step 2: Load the extension

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions` / `edge://extensions`)
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` directory
4. Copy the **extension ID** shown under the extension name

### Step 3: Register native messaging

```bash
./install.sh <your-extension-id>
```

If you use multiple browsers, pass all IDs: `./install.sh <chrome-id> <brave-id> <arc-id>`

### Step 4: Restart your browser

Close **all** windows and reopen. The browser reads native messaging host configs on startup.

### Step 5: Set your OpenAI key and enable the microphone

Right-click the extension icon → **Options**. Both of these are required before
recording:

- Paste your **OpenAI key** and click **Save & validate** (transcribes your narration).
- Click **Enable microphone** and allow the browser prompt. The recorder captures
  audio in a background page that can't show a permission prompt itself, so you
  grant mic access once here; otherwise recordings capture no voice.

### Step 6: Add the server to Claude Code

The **hybrid** server exposes everything: all 19 tools directly, `execute_code`
alongside (the model picks per call), and the recording channel.

```bash
claude mcp add open-claude-in-chrome-hybrid -- node /absolute/path/to/host/codemode/server-hybrid.js
```

Find the absolute path with `echo "$(pwd)/host"`.

### Step 7: Launch with recording enabled

Channels are a research preview, so start Claude Code with the development flag
(the name is the server from step 6):

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:open-claude-in-chrome-hybrid
```

Accept the one-time prompt and keep the session open — channels inject into a
live interactive session, not `claude -p`. That's it: browser automation and
recording are both on.

## Verification

Start a new Claude Code session and run both checks.

**1. Browser control** — confirms the extension, native host and MCP server are wired up:

```
Navigate to reddit.com and take a screenshot
```

Reddit loads. No domain restriction.

**2. The `execute_code` sandbox** — confirms the wrangler sidecar is live:

```
In a single execute_code call: create a new tab, navigate to reddit.com, click
the first post, then go back to the listing and give me every post title except
the top three.
```

You should get the titles back from **one** tool call rather than a
click-screenshot-click sequence. If the first attempt reports the sandbox is
still starting, wait a few seconds and ask again — the sidecar boots in the
background and the first call can arrive before it is ready. If it never comes
up, see [Keeping `execute_code` running](#keeping-execute_code-running).

## Keeping `execute_code` running

**Where it runs.** `execute_code` evaluates your JavaScript in a Cloudflare
Worker (a V8 isolate) hosted by a `workerd` sidecar that the MCP server starts
with `wrangler dev`. That sidecar is a **child process of the MCP server**,
which Claude Code itself spawns. There is no separate daemon, nothing to start
by hand, and nothing that outlives Claude Code. It binds `127.0.0.1` on a free
port, runs out of `host/codemode/worker`, and keeps its state in a per-variant,
per-PID directory under your temp dir so the codemode and hybrid servers can run
at the same time without racing each other.

**Its lifetime is the MCP server's lifetime.** It is spawned in the background
at server start so MCP startup never blocks on it (budget: 60s to boot,
typically 3–5s), and it is torn down on SIGTERM/SIGINT/exit and when Claude Code
closes the stdio pipe. So restarting or reconnecting the MCP server always gives
you a fresh sidecar.

**There is no health check and no auto-restart.** If the sidecar dies
mid-session, `execute_code` stays down until the MCP server restarts. That is
the behaviour to recognise: browser tools still work, only `execute_code` fails.

To keep it reliable:

1. **Install the worker's dependencies** (Step 1, or `./install.sh`). Without
   `host/codemode/worker/node_modules` the server falls back to
   `npx --yes wrangler`, which needs the network on every cold start. This is
   the single most common cause of a sandbox that "sometimes isn't there".
2. **Recover with `/mcp`** in Claude Code. Reconnecting restarts the MCP server,
   which respawns the sidecar.
3. **If that doesn't take, clear strays and reconnect:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "server-hybrid|server-codemode"; pkill -f wrangler
   ```
4. **Confirm it's up.** The server logs `[wrangler] Ready on http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
   and then `sandbox prewarmed in <n>ms`. `pgrep -fl wrangler` should show one
   process per registered codemode/hybrid server.
5. **Expect partial degradation, not failure.** If the sandbox never comes up the
   18 passthrough tools keep working and only `execute_code` errors, so a broken
   sidecar looks like "code mode stopped working", not "the browser stopped
   working".

## Server variants

The hybrid server from Step 6 is the superset and the one the install steps
assume. Two leaner variants exist if you want them, and they can coexist —
register more than one.

**Default** — the 19 tools, nothing else:
```bash
claude mcp add open-claude-in-chrome -- node /absolute/path/to/host/mcp-server.js
```

**Code mode** — three tools: `execute_code`, `screenshot`, `zoom`. The model writes JS that calls `chrome.*` (the typed API for all 19 tools) in a sandboxed Cloudflare Worker, collapsing multi-step flows into one round trip:
```bash
claude mcp add open-claude-in-chrome-codemode -- node /absolute/path/to/host/codemode/server-codemode.js
```

Both of these carry the same sandbox as hybrid, so [Keeping `execute_code` running](#keeping-execute_code-running) applies to them too. Recording is only on the hybrid server.


## Imitation Learning (Recording)

Teach Claude Code a browser task by doing it once. The extension records an
expert rollout in two synchronized tracks — **what you did** (clicks, typing,
scrolling, resolved to durable element anchors) and **why** (your spoken
narration, transcribed) — across every tab, then hands the recording to a live
Claude Code session over a [channel](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels).
Claude reads the rollout and carries out the task, extrapolating to sister
tasks. Enabled by the [Installation](#installation) flow above. Full design:
[`docs/imitation-learning-alignment.html`](docs/imitation-learning-alignment.html).

### Record

1. Tell the session you're about to teach it something.
2. **Click the toolbar icon** to start. The badge walks a fixed pipeline:
   `…` (booting the mic, ~2.5s) → `REC` (talk now). Clicks during `…` are
   ignored.
3. Act and narrate out loud. Hold **Alt** while clicking to demonstrate an
   action *without* it firing (override/mask mode).
4. **Click the icon again** to stop. The badge shows `…` while the recording
   is transcribed and saved — clicks are ignored until the **paste-able
   reference lands on your clipboard** and the icon shows 📋. Only then is the
   icon live again. Paste the reference into Claude Code to point it at the
   recording. (If a Claude session with the channel is connected, it's also
   notified automatically and the tooltip says so — but the clipboard copy
   happens either way.)

Recorded sessions are browsable under the extension's **Options** page (all
captured data, disclosed in layers), each with its own **Copy reference** button.

### Verify recording works

The minimum end-to-end check, the recorder's equivalent of the reddit test
above. Do it in a session launched per step 7.

1. In the Claude Code session, say: *"I'm going to teach you something — wait for my signal."*
2. **Click the toolbar icon** (badge shows `REC`). Navigate to any page, click a
   couple of things, and **say two or three sentences out loud** about what
   you're doing. **Click the icon again** to stop.
3. Confirm:
   - The icon shows a **📋** and the reference is on your clipboard (paste it
     anywhere to check — it points at the recording folder).
   - **Options → Recorded sessions** shows the session with events > 0,
     **utterances > 0**, a working **audio player**, a **frame count**, and your
     words under **Narration**.
   - `trace.json` and `images/` exist under
     `~/.config/open-claude-in-chrome/recordings/<recording_id>/`.
   - If a channel session is connected: a `<channel … event="recording_complete" …>`
     message appears and Claude acknowledges it and reads the trace.

If utterances is 0 or there's no audio, the mic wasn't enabled — redo
Installation step 5. If nothing saved (no 📋), the native host isn't running —
rerun `./install.sh <extension-id>` and restart the browser. If no channel
message appears, the session wasn't launched with the flag in step 7 (or a
stale MCP server is running — `pkill -f "server-hybrid"` and reconnect with
`/mcp`).

**The real test** (beyond the minimum): one narrated rollout of a task, then a
*sister task* — same shape, different specifics — that Claude completes unaided
from the recording. That's the proof the trace teaches rather than replays.

### Status & limitations

The MCP channel, the `recording_ack` round-trip, the primary→client event
routing, the transcription + track merge, and the native-host file writes are
validated outside the browser; the in-browser capture, mic, and stop pipeline
are wired and awaiting your live pass above. Known v1 choices:

- The bundle is written by the **native host** (a Node process with filesystem access) to `~/.config/open-claude-in-chrome/recordings/<id>/` — `trace.json`, `SCHEMA_v0.md`, and `images/`. No `chrome.downloads`, so no OS save dialog, and it saves whether or not Claude is connected.
- **Four tracks**: behavior (discrete actions), cursor (raw trajectory), images (240p frames captured on events, ≤1/sec), narration. All references and files are just data; the agent reads what it wants.
- The viewer keeps small copies of the audio and frames in IndexedDB (the Options page can't read the on-disk files). Long recordings accumulate; a "keep last N" cleanup is a later refinement.
- The capture layer is purpose-built (anchors + effects + heuristics), not a vendored rrweb.

## Code Mode Test Client

A self-explanatory in-browser test suite for comparing default / code-mode / hybrid behavior across the kinds of flow they each should excel at. Lives in `scratch/test-form/`.

### Serve it

```bash
cd scratch/test-form
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

Open `http://localhost:8765/`. The page is a four-challenge suite the agent works through end-to-end:

1. **Single-Screen Form** — everything visible in one screenshot. A model that captures the layout once should be able to batch all clicks + types + submit into a single round trip.
2. **Multi-Step Wizard** — three steps where step 2's fields depend on step 1's choice. Forces screenshot → action → screenshot, no batching across steps.
3. **Repeat Submissions** — the same Challenge 1 form, submitted three times with different values. Coordinates don't change; this is where pre-planned batching pays off most.
4. **Click Sequence** — a 3×3 grid plus a randomly-generated ordering. Every coordinate is visible at once; the model can batch nine sequential clicks from one screenshot.

Completion is non-ambiguous: the suite ends on a green "All Challenges Complete" banner with a per-challenge wall-clock table. A sticky progress header on every page shows the current challenge number and a ✓ for each completed one.

### Run the experiment

```
YOU MUST NOT USE THE FOLLOWING TOOLS IN ANY CAPACITY: form_input || javascript_tool

TASK:
Open http://localhost:8765/ on a new tab and complete every challenge on the page. Follow the on-page instructions until you reach the "All Challenges Complete" banner.

For the MCP use only (not any of the other ocic MCPs): open-claude-in-chrome||open-claude-in-chrome-codemode||open-claude-in-chrome-hybrid
```

What to look for across the three MCP variants:
- Challenge 1: ratio of screenshots to actions. Default tends to look-act-look-act; code-mode/hybrid should look once then batch.
- Challenge 2: all three should look comparable — visual feedback is required between steps regardless of MCP.
- Challenge 3: this is where the gap should open. One screenshot up front, then three batched form-fills in code-mode/hybrid vs. fresh look-act loops in default.
- Challenge 4: similar. Coordinates fixed, sequence visible. Code mode batches the nine clicks; default clicks one at a time.

If the model still uses direct tools on the second submission, that's a signal the `execute_code` description needs tuning — see `host/codemode/common.js` (`buildExecuteCodeDescription`) and the per-server `EXTRA_NOTES`.

#### Final Results Table

## Available Tools

All 19 tools, identical to Claude in Chrome:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tabs_context_mcp` | Get tab group context |

| `computer` | Mouse, keyboard, screenshots (13 actions) |
| `read_page` | Accessibility tree with element refs |
| `get_page_text` | Extract article/main text |
| `find` | Find elements by text/attributes |
| `form_input` | Set form values by ref |
| `javascript_tool` | Execute JS in page context |
| `read_console_messages` | Console output (filtered) |

| `shortcuts_list` | List shortcuts (stub) |
| `shortcuts_execute` | Run shortcut (stub) |
| `switch_browser` | Switch browser (stub) |
| `update_plan` | Present plan (auto-approved) |

## Updating After Code Changes

No build step. All files are plain JavaScript. After pulling or editing code:

| What changed | What to do |
|---|---|
| `extension/background.js`, `extension/content.js`, `extension/manifest.json`, or `extension/recorder/*` | Reload the extension: `brave://extensions` > click the reload icon |
| `host/mcp-server.js` | Kill stale servers and reconnect: `pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"` then `/mcp` in Claude Code |
| `host/codemode/*.js` or `host/codemode/worker/*` | Kill the codemode server: `pkill -f "server-codemode\|server-hybrid"` and `pkill -f wrangler`, then `/mcp` in Claude Code |
| `host/native-host.js` | Restart the browser (close all windows, reopen) |
| `install.sh` or native host name changed | Re-run `./install.sh <extension-id>`, restart browser, re-add MCP |

### Quick reset (nuclear option)

If things are broken and you're not sure why:

```bash
# 1. Kill all MCP servers
pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"

# 2. Re-run install
./install.sh <your-extension-id>

# 3. Restart browser (close all windows, reopen)

# 4. Reload extension in brave://extensions

# 5. Reconnect in Claude Code
# /mcp
```

## Multiple Sessions

Multiple Claude Code sessions can share the same browser extension. The first session becomes the "primary" (owns the TCP port), and subsequent sessions connect as clients through the primary. All sessions can use the browser simultaneously.

If a session disconnects, kill stale servers and reconnect:

```bash
pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"
# then /mcp in each Claude Code session
```

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not connecting

1. Verify the extension is loaded and enabled
2. Check that `./install.sh` was run with the correct extension ID
3. Restart the browser completely (all windows)
4. Verify the native messaging host manifest exists:
   - **Chrome (macOS)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.open_claude_in_chrome.json`
   - **Brave (macOS)**: `~/Library/Application Support/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.open_claude_in_chrome.json`
   - **Edge (macOS)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.open_claude_in_chrome.json`

### MCP server not found

Use an absolute path:
```bash
claude mcp add open-claude-in-chrome -- node /absolute/path/to/host/mcp-server.js
```

### "Browser extension is not connected"

The MCP server started but the native host hasn't connected. Try:
1. Open any webpage (wakes the service worker)
2. Check service worker logs: `chrome://extensions` > "Inspect views: service worker"
3. Verify `host/native-host-wrapper.sh` exists

### Tools fail immediately after reconnect

Stale MCP server processes from previous sessions may be holding the port. Fix:

```bash
pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"
```

Then `/mcp` in Claude Code to reconnect. The fresh server will bind the port and accept the native host connection.

### Port conflict

Default port is 18765. To change:
1. Create `~/.config/open-claude-in-chrome/config.json`:
   ```json
   { "port": 19000 }
   ```
2. Restart browser and Claude Code
